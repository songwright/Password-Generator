# Password Generator

This is an assignment I did for my coding boot camp at UCLA Extension. It generates a password with characters chosen by the user.

* Character type:

  * Special characters

  * Numeric characters

  * Lowercase characters

  * Uppercase characters

The app is available here: https://songwright.github.io/Password-Generator/
